Unformatted docs for the busy developer 
The busy developer is me, and the other busy
developer is the reader. I'm trying to fix
the whole editing process that documentation
requires. If you think of this repo as a way
to write down an irc exchange between two
developers, you'll understand why everything
will be written a certain way.

TL;DR I'd rather have an unformatted text repo
of developer documentation than 100 pages of
LaTeX docs written by a third party out of the 
loop.
