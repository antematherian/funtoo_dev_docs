Skipping the condescending, useless global view, here's the funtoo
way of merging the main portage tree

A bit of history:

The portage tree usually residing in the /usr/portage folder
(set to that value in /etc/portage/repos.conf/gentoo) was
originally distributed through rsync. This is important because
in those days the manifest files distributed with the ebuilds
checksumed the ebuilds themself: if you encounter an ebuild
that checksums the content of the files folder in addition to
the tarballs present in /usr/portage/distfiles, you're reading
the "fat" manifests required because rsync inherently isn't a 
safe protocol. With git and its system of cryptographic hashes
the need for checksuming the portage tree itself is redundant.
Therefore, both Gentoo and Funtoo use thin-manifests. 

Funtoo first switched to distributing the portage tree through
git: if you think that a slimer git-tree-to-git-tree merge script
can be written, keep in mind that it originally was meant to work
with a different protocol. You can see what protocol
is active by looking at the gentoo-staging merge script snapshoted
from http://git.funtoo.org/funtoo-overlay/tree/funtoo/scripts and provided
together with this document as merge-gentoo-staging.py.
